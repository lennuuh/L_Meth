# L_Meth
Simple FiveM meth script for esx framework with 3 steps ( Boiling, crushing and bagging ) using ox_target and ox lib. Didnt feel like doing a config or locale file but maybe in the future i will add those. Locations have to be changed from client.lua, search for vector3 in client.lua and change the coordinates to whatever you want. Join my discord for support https://discord.gg/f7mWnAP5ve.
